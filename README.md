## `Opossum - A Bluetooth Amplifier with AGC` ##
---
A bluetooth-based amplifier with automatic gain control, based on:
  * ATmega328-compatible microcontroller
  * Microchip BM62 Bluetooth module
  * MSGEQ7 spectrum level detector
  * Max9744 I2C-Controllable Class-D Amplifier

The end result being a bluetooth-connected amplifier utilizing a microcontroller for continuously analyzing the output level of the incoming audio, and adjusting the output amplifier level to keep the overall volume of the music relatively consistent.
